                     <p>The breakthrough was amazing. Just three months ago, I was completely lost at where to go. Now I am approaching my goal step by step. Every session with Sherring has led to considerable progress. </p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The first time I talked to her, I went from not knowing what I wanted to finding my own direction. The second time with Sherring, doubt in starting my own business was replaced by confidence. The third session succeeded in defining the target market of my business. The subsequent sessions resulted in me taking a series of actions. Without Sherring and her guidance, none of these would have been possible. Even if you had given me more time, I would not have understood the true meaning of financial freedom and would have made many costly mistakes.</span><br></p><p>The old me was held back by my mentality, thinking I did not have the skill or the capability of being an entrepreneur. But with Sherring’s coaching, I gain a new perspective and realize that there exist infinite possibilities in each of us. I become more positive. This transformation has benefited not only me, but also the people I know. Now, I would seek new opportunities with an open mind, encouraging myself and those around me to take the leap instead of focusing on the risks. I would no longer be easily stopped by naysayers, including myself.
</p><p>I think we have achieved so much in such a short time because Sherring does not force knowledge or reason into my head. She excels at asking questions. Through our dialogue, I gain the clarity required to seek out the solution. I even discover options beyond my imagination. Since the answers come from within, I have a stronger motivation to put them into action.</p>

                     <p>When my friend introduced Sherring to me, I was skeptical and didn't think that coaching could be so effective. She has guided me to find my answer, which has exceeded my expectation.</p><p>I was a bit confused in the beginning as I tried to tackle too many things at once. With Sherring’s guidance, I realized that I was trapped by my own fears. 95% of the time, I was living in fear and my possibilities became limited. When Sherring asked me, “How do you think your life would be different if you can reduce your fears by half?” I was stunned by her question. Later I concluded from real life examples that 70% of my worries were unfounded.
</p><p>I found new measures to combat my fears and get out of my comfort zone through her coaching. I started to spend five minutes each day to think about how to overcome these fears. Every time when a negative thought crept into my mind, I questioned myself, “How will I deal with it if I am not worried about the consequences?” I began to take on challenges which scared me before. Together these little changes have resulted in a huge step forward. I have gained better clarity in where I should go and how to reach my destination. My mind has never been clearer and more focused. Without fear, I see many more possibilities and options, which have further reduced my concerns and strengthened my confidence.
</p><p>I am now my own doctor, who can prescribe the right treatment based on the diagnosis. My abilities and potential have also turned out to be greater than I imagined. My world has grown bigger. I am sure the future will be bright if I continue to live with this new attitude and belief. Thank you Sherring!</p>

                     <p>Sherring’s coaching in the past three months has exceeded my expectations. My biggest takeaways are the discovery of what I did not notice or want to face in the past, as well as the understanding of my actions and their consequences. I got better at self-reflection and seeing things from the perspectives of other people. My relationship with colleagues and subordinates have become more harmonious as a result of my changes. Career-wise, I have achieved a greater clarity in where I want to go and have formulated a realistic strategy to get there.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I really like the way Sherring guides me. Instead of giving me a direct answer, she helps me discover and envision what I desire. She can always reframe and summarize my words in an effective manner. Hearing the differences between what I think and what I say from her has pushed me to explore my thoughts in greater depth. I thought I knew myself. So it came as a surprise to unearth so much I do not know and be enlightened during the process.&nbsp;</span></p><p>​
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Now I realize the path before me is not that treacherous. As long as I know which direction to take, I can reach my destination step-by-step with thorough consideration, good planning and a support network. Never have I been more confident in executing my future plans.</span></p>

                     <p>I am happy to have met a coach who can guide me whenever I stray from the path so that I can focus on what I truly want. By asking the right questions, Sherring has inspired me to think out of the box.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">For people like me who don’t prioritize my goals, it is important to have a coach’s guidance. I am not good at execution and often leave things until the very last minute. As a lone wolf, having only myself to rely on will get me nowhere. Therefore, Sherring’s role proves vital and I am very grateful for her help.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I have neither ever dreamed about launching my own business, nor do I have the courage. Yet I realized typical jobs cannot grant me what I desire. Even though I do not possess certain qualities of successful entrepreneurs, it poses no harm to develop my own business. Our dialogue in the past few months has cleared the fog and guided me towards clarity. Although I do not yet believe I can run a business, I am willing to try and would already be content with a business the scale of a convenient store.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Without this journey with Sherring, I would have remained stuck in the same position instead of getting to where I am now. The new me is courageous and knows what I should do and which path to take.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">To me, Sherring is like a gardener, who would trim the trees when they grow out of control. She is a cheerful person and an attentive and wonderful listener. Yet she has the ability to raise questions that leave you speechless while achieving a better understanding of yourself through self-reflection.</span></p>

                <div class="col-12 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-6">
                     <p>I sought out Sherring to improve the relationship with my husband. The coaching process has shed new light on my perspective – on how I view my feelings, our relationship and marriage, and how important my husband is to me. I realized that I could do much more in so many ways, such as thinking twice before I act and controlling my emotions better. My greatest breakthrough and lesson is knowing when to intervene and when to let go. Talking to Sherring has become a channel for me to express my feelings. And this coach and also friend of mine has inspired me to think more.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">What I did in the past not just failed to improve the relationship with my husband, but also made it worse. I never thought to use an alternative approach. Sherring’s questions, however, have showed me that my previous methods were unable to lead to my desired outcome and it’s high time I made adjustments. The last session in which we reconstructed my experience was immensely helpful: I recalled the things that I used to remind myself about, goals that I set up and methods that worked before, so I know what to do in the future.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Sherring has this quality that makes it feel like you are talking to a friend. Our conversations are always casual and cozy. The places we meet at are where you normally have gatherings with friends instead of formal meetings with your coach. You will not feel any pressure or think there is something wrong with you when talking to Sherring, which I really appreciate. She always listens attentively to what I say and extract certain points to probe into with me. She brings up my previous ideas and motivates me to match onwards. Her trust in me is evident and she never questions my thoughts or feelings. Even when we have exceeded the time limit, she will still respect my wish to continue my sharing.</span></p>

                     <p>Last year I had two coaches that I paid well, but both experiences were unsuccessful. With Sherring, however, every coaching session was a success. I am grateful for her offering me coaching for half a year. I see it as a gift that I receive from the Universe.  
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">As a result of the coaching with Sherring, I better understand the mistakes I made before. I am also able to confront my potential business partners the direction they want to go and realize that we look for different things. I therefore can stop wasting time on fruitless discussion and turn my focus on other opportunities.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Sherring pushes me out of my comfort zone. She never tries to convince me or teach me something but trusts me, trusts my ability to find my own solutions. Whenever I ask her for advice, she always pushes me to look for an answer within myself with her questions. That helps me clear my thoughts, better understand my motivations, and find the right actions to take. Often at the beginning of a session I have some doubts and a decision to make but at the end of the session I am clear what to do next.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Knowing that Sherring would always review with me my actions agreed during the last session at the beginning of a session, I feel highly motivated to prepare for each session. It keeps me focused. She is able to connect the things that we have discussed at different sessions. I have been growing during this coaching period.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Since Sherring is successful herself, such energy has lifted me up and has also been an important element of the success of this coaching. I can also feel that she genuinely wants to see me succeed in achieving my goals.</span></p>

                <div class="col-12 mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-6">
                     <p>When I looked back on the past nine months, I realized how much I have grown and how my consciousness has awakened because of the coaching I have been through. It struck me that I have always lived in my mother’s shadow at work. So my decision to break away from her influence this year has given me great joy.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Every coaching session was useful. Sherring consistently asked me what my “ideal scenario” was for various aspects of life, from relationships to work situations etc, I was made more aware of what I want or don’t want, using the “end goal” / “ideal scenario” to guide my thinking regarding what I can do currently to get closer to where I want to go.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Sherring is the kind of coach who is really easy to talk to. She always remember how I used to be like and what I have said and will remind me of them. With a second pair of eyes to notice patterns in my thoughts/ habits/ actions, I was made aware of my innermost inclinations more readily, gain more insights into myself and my changes in order to learn from the past, and hence make better decisions for the future that suits me.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">I am amazed to realize that I have gone that far when Sherring reviewed my whole coaching journey with me. I now am more convinced that having a coach to regularly meet with and review “life” is crucial—as having that structure of reviewing and exploring goals really helps carry one forward where one maybe “stuck” on one’s own.  Having a friend to chat with is great, but having a coach who has a “structure”, say through taking notes in each session, and being able to pinpoint milestones and patterns is another thing. I think humans really benefit from knowing what kind of progress we have made, or what challenges we have faced (we all learn from history) and Sherring’s coaching provides this structure.</span></p>

                     <p>Sherring guided me through a journey of self-discovery that helped me emerge from my confusion. I found strengths that had been cultivated from my past, and came to understand and embrace my passions. I now stand proud of who I am, and am confident to choose what I love doing. Furthermore, I no longer shy away from facing and dealing with criticisms from my loved ones.
</p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">In her systematic manner, Sherring brought to light something that was of immense use to me, and inspired me to come up with the idea of managing myself as a project. Being a good listener, Sherring was able to distill the key points and potential meanings from my many words. She was observant, comprehended my situation, and has enabled me to realize that how I was affected by certain events subconsciously. I have had other coaches before, but feel that none can compare with Sherring when it comes to devotion. She was sincere in her communication and she dedicated her heart to her client in her coaching. I applaud her. Thank you so much, Sherring.&nbsp;</span></p>

                     <p>When I first met Sherring, my thoughts were in a mess. I wanted to solve many things, and was at a loss of where to start. I was used to judge from a single point of view, strive for perfection with no rhyme or reason and discourage myself by repeating, “I can’t do it” “This method wouldn’t work”. I simply refused any new ideas.
</p><p>
<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Thanks to Sherring’s coaching; I now have learned the importance of considering matters from multiple perspectives and have realized the many choices at my disposal. I manage to strike a balance and feel contented even when I achieve only 80%, which is a huge progress. I also start to question myself, “How would I know if it works or not if I don’t even give it a try?” and am enlightened to make the very first step.&nbsp;</span></p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Becoming more open to new things and new concepts, I socialize with different people, and am more receptive to different opinions. I take part in various activities as well. My perspectives are widened and my knowledge has increased. I am no longer as narrow-minded and negative as before and I really enjoy the current state.</span></p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1rem;">Sherring never told me what to do. She only guided me in my thinking and encouraged me to take action. I am ultimately the one who is responsible for the answer or solution. I now have decided to be kind to myself and focus on my own happiness and health.&nbsp;</span></p>

She was very organized on all of our calls and was able to keep me on task (I can tend to wander when I talk about my experiences) while we went through the various worksheets.</p><p>  Sherring was very professional at all times and was always early for the calls and sent me reminder messages leading up to our call time.  A noticeable strength that Sherring possesses while she took me through the Sacred Gift process was her ability to listen to what I was saying, understand it, and repeat it back to me in an organized and clear way.  </p><p>She was able to take things I talked about on previous calls and help me make connections to the Sacred Gifts that I was listing as my top ones.  She also went over my Sacred Gifts goals, plans and actions, outcomes of my top gifts. </p><p>I can't think of anything that Sherring could have done to make my experience any more awesome than it was. It is in my opinion that Sherring is very qualified in taking future people through the Sacred Gift process and that they will have a great experience, like I did.</p>
